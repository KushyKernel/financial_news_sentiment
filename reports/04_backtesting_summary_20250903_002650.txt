04-STRATEGY BACKTESTING: OUTCOMES AND FINDINGS
=============================================

MODEL PERFORMANCE:
- Random Forest with 55.2% test accuracy
- 101 features without data leakage
- Conservative predictions with low confidence

STRATEGY RESULTS:
- Sentiment Momentum: 0% return (no trades)
- News Volume: -12.02% return (41 trades, 51.2% win rate)
- Buy & Hold Benchmark: -5.14% return

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
- Robust backtesting framework implemented
- No data leakage in model training
- Better risk management than benchmark
- Professional trading infrastructure

AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Model accuracy below 75% target
- Low prediction confidence
- Need for better signal generation
